Course Description
----

In this course, you'll create end-to-end solutions to machine learning problems. This course will cover popular applied techniques in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning, such as regression, classification, and clustering. You'll learn how to properly engineer features, apply algorithms, and evaluate model performance. The focus of the course will be Python's [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) library.

Learning Outcomes
-----

By the end of the course, you should be able to:     

1. Build end-to-end machine learning systems to answer meaningful Data Science questions.
1. Write idiomatic code in Python's scikit-learn package to model data.
1. Recognize when to and _when not to_ apply machine learning techniques.
1. Complete data science take-home challenges that you might encounter during job interviews.
